01) An integer variable can be defined as:

  int intname = intvalue;

  eg.
  int age = 19;

02) You can cout an integer like:

  cout<<19<<endl;

  You can use math operations for cout too:

  Code:                                      Output:
  cout<<10+13<<endl;                         23
  
  int a = 10, b = 14;
  cout<<a+b<<endl;                           24

03) Different math operations are:

  Operator          Symbol    Syntax   Example Code    Example Output

  Addition          +         a+b      a=10, b=12      22
  Subtraction       -         a-b      a=22, b=10      12
  Multiplication    *         a*b      a=4, b=3        12
  Division          /         a/b      a=24, b=6       4
  Modulus           %         a%b      a=10, b=3       1

04) You can use these math operators to use them with variables like:

  Code:
  int a = 10, b = 12;
  cout<<a+b<<endl;

  Output:
  22

05) Using the division operator will only give you the quotient as the result.

06) BODMAS is followed.

07) You can redefine a value of an integer using the same variable's previous value like:

  Code:
  int a = 10;
  a = a + 10;
  cout <<a<<endl;

  Output:
  20

08) Shorthands:

  Shorthand      Fullform      Example Code      Example Output
  a+=k           a = a + k     a = 10, k = 13    a= 23
  a-=k           a = a - k     a = 13, k = 10    a= 3
  a*=k           a = a * k     a = 10, k = 13    a= 130
  a/=k           a = a / k     a = 21, k = 7     a= 3
  a++            a = a + 1     a = 10            a= 11
  a--            a = a - 1     a = 10            a= 9

09) Advanced Mathematical Operators:

  You can use advanced mathematical operators by including this line under the "#include <iostream>" line (no need for "#include <bits/stdc++.h>"):

  #include <cmath>

  Operator                  Output
  pow(a, b)                 2^5
  sqrt(a)                   Square root of a
  round(a)                  Round off a to nearest integer
  ceil(a)                   Round the number UP to the nearest integer (LIF)
  floor(a)                  Round the number DOWN to the nearest integer (GIF)
  fmax(a, b)                Max of a and b
  fmin(a, b)                Min of a and b
