01) Strings can be defined like:

  string stringname = "stringvalue";

  eg.
  string name = "John";

02) You can cout a string like:

  eg.
  cout<<"Hello World"<<endl;

03) To concatenate strings, you can do it like:

  string name = "John";
  string sentence = "His name is " + name;
	cout<<sentence<<endl;

04) You can't concatenate strings with other data types unless in cout (with a very specific method)

05) You can find the length of a string using:

  stringname.length();

  Code:
  string name = "John";
  cout<<name.length()<<endl;

  Output:
  4

06) To grab a character from a string you can use:

  stringname[index];

  Indexing starts from 0.

  eg.
  John
  0123

  All characters including spaces and special characters count while indexing.

  Code:
  string name = "John";
  cout<<name[0]<<endl;
  cout<<name[2]<<endl;

  Output:
  J
  h

07) To check if a certain substring is part of a string, you can use:

  stringname.find(substring, searchstartingindex);

  this will return the index position of the starting letter of the substring.

  leaving searchstartingindex blank will assume from start.

  Code:
  string name = "John";
  cout<<name.find("oh", 0)<<endl;

  Output:
  1

  Explanation:
  The find function looks for the substring "oh" from the index position 0 in string name, and it find it to start from the index position 1.

  In case of multiple occurences of the substring inside the string, only the position of the first occurence within the index limits is returned.

  If a substring is not present, the value ouputted will be a very huge value which will be way higher than the length of the string.

08) To grab a substring from a string, you can use:

  stringname.substr(startingindex, substringlength);

  Code:
  string name = "John Lenon";
  cout<<name.substr(2, 4);

  Output:
  hn L

09) You can define a variable with the values from these functions as well.

10) To cin a whole line of a string (which includes the spaces inside it) as whole as value of a string variable, use:

  getline(inputfunction, variablename);

  Code:
  string s;
  getline(cin, s);
  cout<<s<<endl;

  Input:
  Hello, today's a good day.
