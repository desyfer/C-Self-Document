01) A variable in C++ can be defined like:

  variabletype variablename = variablevalue;

  or,

  variabletype variablename;
  variablename = variablevalue;

  eg.
  int a = 10;
  int name = "John";
  char grade = 'F';
  bool pass = false;
  double gpa = 2.3;

02) Different types of variables (ie. data types) are:

  char - characters (single letters)
  strings - Words
  bool - boolean (true/false)
  int - integers
  double/float - decimals (for very basic things, they are same, but the difference is for advanced stuff)

03) You can redefine the value of a variable and the value for that variable is change to this value for the code that is AFTER (not BEFORE) the redefinition.

  Code:
  string name = "John";
  cout<<name<<" is very old."<<endl;
  name = "Smith";
  cout<<name<<" is very old."<<endl;

04) While defining multiple variables of the same type, you can do like this:

  variabletype var1 = val1, var2 = val2, var3 = val3....;

  eg.
  int a = 10, b = 5;

  or,
  int a = 10, b;
  int b = 5;

  or,
  int a, b;
  a = 10;
  b = 5;

05) While naming a variable with multiple letters, space should not be used. Also it is a standard that the first word should be lowercase, while the following words to be capitalised.

  eg.
  int myAge;
