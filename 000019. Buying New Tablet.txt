Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: TABLET

Problem Statement:
Chef decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B. Other than that, he only has one criterion — the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.

Chef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are N available tablets, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.

Help Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and B.

N lines follow. For each i (1≤i≤N), the i-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers Wi, Hi and Pi.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line. If Chef cannot buy any tablet, it should contain the string "no tablet" (without quotes). Otherwise, it should contain a single integer — the maximum area of the screen of a tablet Chef can buy.

Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤B≤1,000,000
1≤Pi≤1,000,000 for each valid i
1≤Wi,Hi≤10,000 for each valid i

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, n, b, p, w, h, a;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i =0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n>>b;
		a=0;
		int c[n] = {0};
		for(int r = 0; r<n; r++) {
			cin>>w>>h>>p;
			if(p<=b) {
				c[r] = w*h;
			}
		}
		for(int m = 0; m<n; m++) {
			if(a<c[m]) {
				a=c[m];
			}
		}
		if(a==0) {
			cout<<"no tablet"<<endl;
		} else {
			cout<<a<<endl;
		}
	}
	return 0;
