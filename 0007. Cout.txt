01) To output something, you can write it with "cout<<" operator.

  Code:
  cout<<"Hello World";

  Output:
  Hello World

02) To add a new line at the end of a specific output, you can write "<<endl" at the end.

  Code:
  cout<<"Hello World"<<endl<<"how are you"<<endl;

  Output:
  Hello World
  how are you

03) Strings are always outputted inside "" while integers, booleans, etc. aren't.

  Code:
  cout<<"Hello"<<endl;
  cout<<10<<endl;

  Output:
  Hello
  10

04) Values of variables can be directly outputted by writing with cout without "".

  Code:
  string greeting = "Hello";
  cout<<greeting<<endl;

  Output:
  Hello

05) You can concatenate strings with variable strings to output them as whole like:

  Code:
  string bye = "goodnight";
  cout<<"I am going to sleep " + "bye" + "Until tomorrow."

  OUtput:
  I am going sleep goodnight. Until tomorrow.

  NOTE: You can't use strings with other data types by directly concatenating them together like this (use 06 if you want to use mutliple data types together).

06) Another way to concatenate strings for output is to do it like this.

  Code:
  int name = "John";
  int age = 70;

  cout<<"His name is "<<name<<endl;
  cout<<"His age is "<<age<<endl;

  Output:
  His name is John
  His age is 70

07) You can directly output math operations like:

  Code:
  int a = 10;
  int b = 12;

  cout<<a+b<<endl;

  Output:
  22

07) printf can be used instead of cout which makes it faster, but it also makes it more difficult to use.
