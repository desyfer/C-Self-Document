Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: CHFINTRO

Problem Statement:
What the hell are all these interactive problems? What does flushing output mean? So many questions… Chef explains it in an easy way: you must communicate with a grader program, which accepts your input only if you flushed the output.

There is a contest with interactive problems where N people participate. Each contestant has a known rating. Chef wants to know which contestants will not forget to flush the output in interactive problems. Fortunately, he knows that contestants with rating at least r never forget to flush their output and contestants with rating smaller than r always forget to do it. Help Chef!

Input:
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers N and r.

Each of the following N lines contains a single integer R denoting the rating of one contestant.

Output:
For each contestant, print a single line containing the string "Good boi" if this contestant does not forget to flush the output or "Bad boi" otherwise.

Constraints:
1≤N≤1,000
1,300≤r,R≤1,501

Sample Input:
2 1500
1499
1501

Sample Output:
Bad boi
Good boi

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int N, r, R;
	cin>>N>>r;
	for(int i = 0; i<N; i++) {
		cin>>R;
		if(R>=r) {
			cout<<"Good boi"<<endl;
		} else {
			cout<<"Bad boi"<<endl;
		} 
	}
	return 0;
