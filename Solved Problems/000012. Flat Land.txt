Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: ICL1902

Problem Statement:
In the 2-D world of Flatland, the Circles were having their sports day and wanted to end it with a nice formation. So, they called upon Mr. Sphere from Spaceland for help. Mr Sphere decides to arrange the Circles in square formations. He starts with N Circles and forms the largest possible square using these Circles. He then takes the remaining Circles and repeats the procedure. A square of side S requires S2 Circles to create.

Find the number of squares he will be able to form at the end of the process.

Input:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
Each testcase contains of a single integer N.

Output:
For each testcase, output a single integer denoting the number of squares.

Constraints:
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤1000

Sample Input:
2
85
114

Sample Output:
2
4

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, n, a, b;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n;
		a = 0;
		while(n>0) {
			b = sqrt(n);
			n-=b*b;
			a++;
		}
		cout<<a<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
