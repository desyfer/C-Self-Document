Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: THREEFR

Problem Statement:
There are three friends; let's call them A, B, C. They made the following statements:

A: "I have x Rupees more than B."
B: "I have y rupees more than C."
C: "I have z rupees more than A."
You do not know the exact values of x,y,z. Instead, you are given their absolute values, i.e. X=|x|, Y=|y| and Z=|z|. Note that x, y, z may be negative; "having −r rupees more" is the same as "having r rupees less".

Find out if there is some way to assign amounts of money to A, B, C such that all of their statements are true.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X, Y and Z.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if the presented scenario is possible or "no" otherwise (without quotes).

Constraints:
1≤T≤1,000 
1≤X,Y,Z≤1,000

Sample Input:
2
1 2 1
1 1 1

Sample Output:
yes
no

Solution:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, x, y, z;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>x>>y>>z;
		if(x+y == z || x+z == y || y+z == x) {
			cout<<"yes"<<endl;
		} else {
			cout<<"no"<<endl;
		}
	}
  return 0;
