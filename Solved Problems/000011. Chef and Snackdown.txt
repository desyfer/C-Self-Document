Input:
Chef is interested in the history of SnackDown contests. He needs a program to verify if SnackDown was hosted in a given year.

SnackDown was hosted by CodeChef in the following years: 2010, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019.

Output:
For each test case print a single line containing the string "HOSTED" if SnackDown was hosted in year N or "NOT HOSTED" otherwise (without quotes)

Constraints:
1≤T≤10 
2010≤N≤2019

Sample Input:

2019
2018

Sample Output:
HOSTED
NOT HOSTED

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int y[5] = {2010, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019};
	int t, n, a;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i =0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n;
		a=0;
		for(int r=0; r<5; r++) {
			if(y[r] == n) {
				a++;
			}
		}
		if(a>0) {
			cout<<"HOSTED"<<endl;
		} else {
			cout<<"NOT HOSTED"<<endl;
		}
	}
	return 0;
