Problem Statement:
Chef belongs to a very rich family which owns many gold mines. Today, he brought N gold coins and decided to form a triangle using these coins. Isn't it strange?

Chef has a unusual way of forming a triangle using gold coins, which is described as follows:

He puts 1 coin in the 1st row.
then puts 2 coins in the 2nd row.
then puts 3 coins in the 3rd row.
and so on as shown in the given figure.

Chef is interested in forming a triangle with maximum possible height using at most N coins. Can you tell him the maximum possible height of the triangle?

Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The first and the only line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of gold coins Chef has.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the maximum possible height of the triangle that Chef can get.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9

Sample Input:
3
3
5
7

Sample Output:
2
2
3

Solution:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	long long int t, n;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n;
		cout<<floor((-1 + sqrt(1+8*n))/2)<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

Explanation:

(a)(a+1)/2 = n
a^2+a-2n = 0
a = floor((-1 + sqrt(1+8n))/2)
