Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: MATCHES

Problem Statement:
Chef's son Chefu found some matches in the kitchen and he immediately starting playing with them.

The first thing Chefu wanted to do was to calculate the result of his homework — the sum of A and B, and write it using matches. Help Chefu and tell him the number of matches needed to write the result.

Digits are formed using matches in the following way:
(pic: https://www.codechef.com/problems/MATCHES)

0 - 6
1 - 2
2 - 5
3 - 5
4 - 4
5 - 5
6 - 6
7 - 3
8 - 7
9 - 6

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers A and B.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of matches needed to write the result (A+B).

Constraints:
1≤T≤1,000
1≤A,B≤106

Sample Input:
3
123 234
10101 1010
4 4

Sample Output:
13
10
7

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, a, b, c, d, e;
	int m[10] = {6, 2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 6};
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>a>>b;
		c = a + b;
		d = 0;
		for(int r = 0; c>0; r++) {
			e = c%10;
			d+=m[e];
			c/=10;
		}
		cout<<d<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
