Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: CHN15A

Problem Statement:
Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.

Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer K to each of the minions' characteristic value.

Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.

Given the initial characteristic integers of N minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

Input:
The first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of test cases. Each test case is then described in two lines.

The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement.

The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions.

Output:
For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ 100
All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.

Sample Input:
1
5 10
2 4 1 35 1

Sample Output:
1

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, n, k, a, c;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i =0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n>>k;
		c=0;
		for(int r = 0; r<n; r++) {
			cin>>a;
			if((a+k)%7 == 0) {
				c++;
			}
		}
		cout<<c<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
