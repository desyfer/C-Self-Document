Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: CANDY123

Problem Statement:
Bears love candies and games involving eating them. Limak and Bob play the following game. Limak eats 1 candy, then Bob eats 2 candies, then Limak eats 3 candies, then Bob eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses.

Limak can eat at most A candies in total (otherwise he would become sick), while Bob can eat at most B candies in total. Who will win the game? Print "Limak" or "Bob" accordingly.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers A and B denoting the maximum possible number of candies Limak can eat and the maximum possible number of candies Bob can eat respectively.

Output:
For each test case, output a single line containing one string — the name of the winner ("Limak" or "Bob" without the quotes).

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000

Solution:

I) Solution 1:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, a, b, r;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>a>>b;
		r = 1;
		while(a>=0 && b>=0) {
			if(r%2!=0) {
				a-=r;
			} else if(r%2==0) {
				b-=r;
			}
			if(a<0 && b>=0) {
				cout<<"Bob"<<endl;
			} else if (a>=0 && b<0) {
				cout<<"Limak"<<endl;
			}
			r++;
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

II) Solution II:

  Using AP formula, form a quadratic in, and use n = (-b+ sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/(2*a) to find each n, and compare which is greater.


	n/2{2a -d + nd} = S
	n^2(d) + n(2a - d) - 2S = 0
	D = (2a - d)^2 + 4(d)(2S)

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, a, b, aD, bD, x, y;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0 ; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>a>>b;
		aD = 8 * 2 * a;
		bD = 4 + 8 * 2 * b;
		x = floor(sqrt(aD)/4);
		y = floor((sqrt(bD)-2)/4);
		if(x>y) {
			cout<<"Limak"<<endl;
		} else if(y>=x) {
			cout<<"Bob"<<endl;
		}
	}
	return 0;
