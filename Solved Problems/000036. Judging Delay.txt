Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: JDELAY

Problem Statement:
You have been recently hired as a developer in CodeChef. Your first mission is to implement a feature that will determine the number of submissions that were judged late in a contest.

There are N submissions, numbered 1 through N. For each valid i, the i-th submission was submitted at time Si and judged at time Ji (in minutes). Submitting and judging both take zero time. Please determine how many submissions received their verdicts after a delay of more than 5 minutes.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.

The first line of the input contains a single integer N.

N lines follow. For each valid i, the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers Si and Ji.

Output:
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of submissions for which the judging was delayed by more than 5 minutes.

Constraints:
1≤T≤100 
1≤N≤100
1≤Si≤Ji≤300 for each valid i

Sample Input:
1
5
1 3
4 4
4 10
1 11
2 7

Sample Output:
2

Solution:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, n, j, s, a;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n;
		a=0;
		for(int r = 0; r<n; r++) {
			cin>>s>>j;
			if((j-s)>5) {
				a++;
			}
		}
		cout<<a<<endl;
	}
  return 0;
