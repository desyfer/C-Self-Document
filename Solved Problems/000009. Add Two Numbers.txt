Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: FLOW001

Problem Statement:
Shivam is the youngest programmer in the world, he is just 12 years old. Shivam is learning programming and today he is writing his first program.

Program is very simple, Given two integers A and B, write a program to add these two numbers.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of test cases. Then follow T lines, each line contains two Integers A and B.

Output:
For each test case, add A and B and display it in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
0 ≤ A,B ≤ 10000

Sample Input:
3 
1 2
100 200
10 40

Sample Output:
3
300
50

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t, a, b;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>a>>b;
		cout<<a+b<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
