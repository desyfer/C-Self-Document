Contest Code: PRACTICE
Problem Code: FLOW005

Problem Statement:
Consider a currency system in which there are notes of six denominations, namely, Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100.
If the sum of Rs. N is input, write a program to computer smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs. N.

Input:
The first line contains an integer T, total number of testcases. Then follow T lines, each line contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case, display the smallest number of notes that will combine to give N, in a new line.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

Sample Input:
3 
1200
500
242

Sample Output:
12
5
7

Solution:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int d[6] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100};
	int t, n, c, a;
	cin>>t;
	for(int i = 0; i<t; i++) {
		cin>>n;
		c=0;
		for(int r = 1; r<=6; r++) {
			a = d[6-r];
			c+=n/a;
			n%=a;
		}
		cout<<c<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
